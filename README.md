# Blowdetector
An app used to perform a user study exploring the use of blowing as input in mobile applications.

# User Study
Two experiments were carried out.  The first was a Fitts’s law task that contained two conditions.  The baseline condition involved the use of the tapping method, thesecond condition used blowing.  The second experiment includeda reaction time task with 3 conditions.  In the first experiment, 4 degrees of difficulty in decreasing order were presented for each Fitts’s law task,each containing 18 trials.  The second experiment included 20 trials for each reactiontime tasks.
